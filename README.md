# HebrewFixer

A Windows tray utility that improves Hebrew (RTL) typing and paste behavior in apps that struggle with BiDi/RTL text (notably Affinity apps). Think of it like a small “input stabilizer” you toggle on when you need it.

- Auto-enables when your active keyboard layout is Hebrew
- Toggle hotkey: `Ctrl+Alt+H`
- BiDi-aware paste fixing
