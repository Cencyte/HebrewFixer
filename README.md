# HebrewFixer

A small Windows tray utility that makes Hebrew (RTL) typing and paste behave correctly in apps that don’t support BiDi/RTL well (e.g., Affinity apps).

- Auto-enables when a Hebrew keyboard layout is active
- Toggle on/off hotkey: `Ctrl+Alt+H`
- BiDi-aware paste fixing

## Install
Download and run `HebrewFixer_Setup.exe` from:
https://github.com/Cencyte/HebrewFixer/releases/

## Use
Launch it, then switch your Windows keyboard to Hebrew. Use the tray menu for status and settings.
