Hi Sara,

I have made significant progress on the solution. 

These are the constraints I encountered:

1. Affinity programs don't support RTL text, even if you type with a Hebrew keyboard.
2. There is no free alternative to the RTL Fixer program. 

However, despite these limitations, I dug deeper and created a program myself that works very similarly to RTL Fixer. I named it "HebrewFixer". 

Here's how to use it: 

1. Select the Hebrew input method in Windows 11 (🪟+Spacebar, or Alt+Shift)
2. Activate HebrewFixer with the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Alt + H"
3. Open Affinity Designer and type some text. 

You will see that the text types Right-to-Left. You can also paste copied Hebrew text, and it will preserve it intact. Attached is a video example of the program working in Affinity Designer:

Also attached in this email is a PDF guide with the exact steps you need to follow to recreate my exact setup.
- Enable the Hebrew language input method in Windows 11
- Install and use the HebrewFixer program
